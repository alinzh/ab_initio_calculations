## Intro

This project deals with the theoretical simulations data from the [MPDS](https://developer.mpds.io). The final aim is to make sure in the highest possible quality of the inputs for machine learning and machine reasoning.


## Technical details

The code is based on [MPDS API](https://developer.mpds.io).
